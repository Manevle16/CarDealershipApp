<h1> Car Dealership Game</h1>

<img src ='https://i.imgur.com/I2uZkUb.jpg/'>

<p> This is a car dealership game made for my database systems class using React, Redux, and AWS services. </p>

<p> As seen in the picture above, the goal of the game is to make as much money as you can. A user will buy cars and sell them at a higher price. The chance of the customer buying the car is displayed when haggling, and the choice of cars and customers can be refreshed on 30 second intervals. </p>

<p> This web client was originally hosted on S3, the server on an Ubuntu instance on the EC2, and the database on the RDS, but keeping them up on AWS is costly so everything is now terminated. </p>
